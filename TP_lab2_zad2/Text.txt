My name IS Yulya. I a.m student. One of my hobbies is travelling. I have alr-
eady visited many parts of Ukraine but my dream is a world tour. 
As I am student, I do not have enough money for it. The only way out is my favourite TV programme "Around the World". 
It is a daily programme, so I have an opportunity to visit different countries every day without leaving my house!

Man came to these lands in the middle Palaeolithic times. But it was only in the middle of the first millennium that Slavs settled here. 
East-Slav tribes of Krivichi, Dregovichi and Radimichi were the Belarusian people's ancestors.
