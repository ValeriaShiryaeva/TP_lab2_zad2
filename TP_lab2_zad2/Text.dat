From 1500 till 1502 Leonardo travelled from one city to another until he entered the service of the notorious son of Pope Alexander VI, 
Cesare Borgia as «senior military architect and general engineer». Only his «appetite to life» can explain Leonardo's decision. 
For ten months he travelled across the territories and sketched some of the city plans and topographical maps that laid the groundwork 
for modern cartography.
London is the capital of the United Kingdom, one of the largest and one of the world's most enjoyable cities. It offers the tourists 
an astonishing variety of scene. In this historic city the modern rubs shoulders with the old, the present is ever conscious of the past,
the great and the small live side by side in mutual tolerance and respect.
